_A Record Keeper for Final Fantasy Record Keeper_

Based on [electron-react-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/iRath96/electron-react-typescript-boilerplate)

## To Do

1. React error boundaries
2. Stateless components
3. Error reporting (Sentry?)
4. Responsive (e.g., nav bar collapses)
5. Standardize React style - default export vs. named export, where to connect
